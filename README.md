# RESORTIC
<!-- PROJECT LOGO -->
The most important thing before going on an adventure or a business trip is to have a place to stay. It becomes cumbersome to scour through the internet and asking friends for resort suggestions, involving multiple phone calls to check availability and prices and then booking a room.
Resortic aims at providing a seamless way to search and reserve a room/s at multiple destinations for their stay. Anyone can look for various available resorts in a particular destination or even plan for a new trip looking at the “most famous destinations” section. Details about the resort like brief description, amenities, types of rooms, and prices are provided to help decide the best place to stay.


Welcome! we hope you enjoy the site as much as we enjoyed making it.

# Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

- [Ant design](https://ant.design/)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
